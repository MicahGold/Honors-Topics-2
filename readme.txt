The code works with a dictionary that automatically adjusts the bitsize (saved as a variable) depending
on how big the input is. There is some redundancy in the code, but it works well enough. It takes in the
input, adds it all to the dictionary with binary keys, and concatenates the message into a huge binary
string. Lastly, it regroups that large binary string and prints the encoded output.
